Refined Core Concept
A private, invite-only digital memory board for couples where they can upload one memory per day (text, image, or audio). Each day, an algorithm randomly selects N past memories to be displayed, and both partners can react with a thumbs-up, increasing the chance of that memory being shown in the future.

Updated Features & Functionality
🔐 Privacy & Relationship Management
Invite-Only Access: Each user can join one relationship via an invite link.

Private Board: No one outside the relationship can see the content.

Firebase Authentication: Google Sign-in or email/password login.

📜 Memory Uploading (Once Per Day)
Each partner can upload one memory per day (text, image, or audio).

Memories are stored in Firebase Firestore & Storage.

No editing or deleting after submission (to keep authenticity).

🎲 Daily Memory Display Algorithm
Every day, N memories are randomly selected and displayed.

Memories with more thumbs-ups have a higher chance of appearing.

This creates a nostalgic and emotional daily experience.

👍 Reaction System (Thumbs-Up Boost)
Both partners can react to the daily memories with a thumbs-up.

More thumbs-ups = higher weight in the random selection process.

Encourages partners to cherish and revisit special moments.

📅 Long-Term Memory Curation
Users can browse past memories via a timeline or calendar view.

Possible filters (e.g., "Show only text memories," "Show anniversaries").

📩 Notifications & Reminders
Daily reminder: "Upload a memory today!"

Morning notification: "Here are your daily memories 💖"
